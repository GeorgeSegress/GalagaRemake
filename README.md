# Galaga Remake
A remake I did for a computer game design and development class project, remaking Galaga using the unity engine. Attached are all art assets and scripts obtained from The Spriters Resource. Below is a video demonstration of the gameplay. Scripts are properly commented, but of note are the enemy manager and enemy scripts, which do a good job of replicating the AI in the original game.
